# Proxy Error and Registration Timeout Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Proxy Error: Could not proxy request from localhost:3000 to http://localhost:5000
**Problem**: Frontend was trying to connect to production backend instead of local backend

**Root Cause**: Frontend .env file was configured to use production URLs

**Solution**: Updated frontend/.env to use local development URLs

**Changes Made**:
```properties
# BEFORE (Production URLs active)
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://tic-tac-toe-uf5h.onrender.com/api
REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=https://tic-tac-toe-uf5h.onrender.com

# AFTER (Development URLs active)
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### 2. Registration Timeout Error
**Problem**: Registration was taking too long and timing out

**Root Cause**: Email verification was enabled and email service was causing delays

**Solution**: Temporarily disabled email verification for development

**Changes Made**:
```properties
# BEFORE
EMAIL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED=true

# AFTER
EMAIL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED=false
```

## Configuration Summary

### Frontend Configuration (frontend/.env)
- ✅ API URL: `http://localhost:5000/api` (local backend)
- ✅ Socket URL: `http://localhost:5000` (local backend)
- ✅ Proxy in package.json: `"proxy": "http://localhost:5000"`

### Backend Configuration (backend/.env)
- ✅ Port: `5000` (matches frontend proxy)
- ✅ Email verification: `false` (for faster development)
- ✅ MongoDB connection: Active

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Test Proxy Connection
- Open browser dev tools
- Check Network tab
- Registration requests should go to `localhost:3000/api/auth/register` (proxied to localhost:5000)

### 2. Test Registration Flow
- Fill out registration form
- Should complete quickly without timeout
- User should be created with `isEmailVerified: true` (since verification is disabled)
- Should redirect to login page with success message

### 3. Test Other API Endpoints
- Login should work immediately after registration
- Profile updates should work
- Game creation should work

## Development vs Production

### Development Setup (Current)
- Frontend: `localhost:3000` → Backend: `localhost:5000`
- Email verification: Disabled
- Fast registration without email delays

### Production Setup (When deploying)
- Frontend: `https://tictactoenisar.netlify.app` → Backend: `https://tic-tac-toe-uf5h.onrender.com`
- Email verification: Enabled
- Proper email service configuration required

## Next Steps

1. **Test Registration**: Try registering a new user - should work without timeouts
2. **Test Login**: Login with the newly registered user
3. **Test Game Flow**: Create and play games
4. **Re-enable Email Verification**: For production deployment, set `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED=true` and ensure email service is properly configured

## Troubleshooting

If you still see proxy errors:
1. Restart both frontend and backend servers
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check that backend is actually running on port 5000
4. Verify no other services are using port 5000

If registration still times out:
1. Check backend console for email service errors
2. Verify MongoDB connection
3. Check network connectivity
4. Consider increasing timeout in frontend API client (currently 30 seconds)
